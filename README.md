# FGR-NET

- The project web for "FGR-Net: Interpretable Fundus Image Gradeability Classification Based on Deep Reconstruction Learning" in May 2022.

- The Eye-Quality (EyeQ) Assessment Dataset is a re-annotated subset of the EyePACS dataset that is used to measure fundus image quality.

- The EyeQ dataset contains 28,792 retinal pictures with three quality levels ('Good,' 'Usable,' and 'Reject'). 

- The original fundus images could be downloaded from the EyePACS dataset.

-  We also release our FGR-Net model in the './FGRNET' folder.

- If you use the Eye-Quality (EyeQ) dataset, you can find in the following papers:
